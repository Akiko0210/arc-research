                Why animals can outrun robots

            <div className="rounded-xl p-4 bg-background backdrop-blur-lg">
                Strategies for robot locomotion have often taken inspiration from animals. But robots still fall short when compared to the inherent performance of animals. Burden et al. review the literature and discuss why animals outrun robots in categories such as agility, range, and robustness. The authors highlight that, with few exceptions, engineering outperforms biology in the components critical for running, so they conclude that there must be as-yet-undiscovered principles of integration and control that give animals their advantage over robots. â€”Amos Matsiko
